# Specifying behaviour

The goal of this project is to show how behaviour can be specified with different programming languages and their individual features.
For Python `typing.Protocols` is used. For the Rust/Scala implementation traits and typeclasses are used respecitvely.

## Setup

Install [nix](!https://nixos.org/download.html) and [direnv](!https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html).

Afterwards execute
```bash
 direnv allow
```

and reload your shell. Now you should be ready to go and can execute the scripts. For example via `just run-python`
